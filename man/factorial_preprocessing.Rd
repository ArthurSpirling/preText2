\title{A function to perform factorial preprocessing of a corpus of texts
into quanteda document-frequency matrices.}
\usage{
factorial_preprocessing(
  text,
  use_ngrams = TRUE,
  infrequent_term_threshold = 0.01,
  parallel = FALSE,
  cores = 1,
  intermediate_directory = NULL,
  parameterization_range = NULL,
  return_results = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A vector of strings (one per document) or quanteda
corpus object from which we wish to form a document-term matrix.}

\item{use_ngrams}{Option to include 1,2, and 3-grams as another potential
preprocessing step. Defaults to TRUE (128 combinations). Set to FALSE
for 64 combinations.}

\item{infrequent_term_threshold}{A proportion threshold at which
infrequent terms are to be filtered. Defaults to 0.01 (terms
that appear in less than 1 percent of documents).}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether factorial preprocessing
should be performed in parallel. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{Defaults to 1, can be set to any number less than or
equal to the number of cores on one's computer.}

\item{intermediate_directory}{Optional path to a directory where
each dfm will be saved as an intermediate step.}

\item{parameterization_range}{Defaults to NULL, but can be set to a
numeric vector of indexes relating to preprocessing
decisions. This can be used to restart large analyses after
power failure.}

\item{return_results}{Defaults to TRUE, can be set to FALSE to
prevent an overly large dfm list from being created.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether more information should
be printed to the screen to let the user know about progress in
preprocessing. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list object with three elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{choices}: a data.frame of preprocessing specifications
  \item \code{dfm_list}: a list of quanteda dfm objects
  \item \code{labels}: character vector of labels for each specification
}
}
\description{
Preprocesses a corpus of texts into a document-frequency matrix
in 64 or 128 different ways (depending on whether n-grams are included),
using the modern quanteda (v4+) tokens-based pipeline.
